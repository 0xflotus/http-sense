- [ ] Store request bytes
- [ ] Maybe use hyper for more low-level http proxy


- What is interesting for user:
    - The request sent by client to proxy_server
    - The response sent by server to proxy
    - What is not interesting, althought these will be mostly same
        - Request sent by proxy to server
        - Response sent by proxy to client

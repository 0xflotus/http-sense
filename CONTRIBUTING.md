# Contributing to HTTP Sense

We welcome contributions to HTTP Sense! If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, we would love to hear from you.

### Getting started

First, make sure you have a GitHub account and have installed Git on your local machine. Then, fork the HTTP Sense repository and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-sense.git

# Navigate to the repository directory
cd http-sense
```

Next, create a new branch for your changes. It's a good practice to use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you plan to make.

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch new-feature

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-feature
```

Now you are ready to make your changes!

To spin up your dev server, please refer to the [Setting up the repository for development](https://github.com/http-sense/http-sense#setting-up-the-repository-for-development) section from the README.md

### Submitting your changes

Once you have made your changes, commit them to your branch and push them to your fork of the repository.

```bash
# Add your changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push the changes to your fork
git push origin new-feature
```

Finally, open a pull request on the HTTP Sense repository. Make sure to include a clear description of your changes and any relevant issues or references.

We will review your pull request and provide feedback as needed. Once your changes have been reviewed and accepted, they will be merged into the main repository.

Thank you for contributing to HTTP Sense!
